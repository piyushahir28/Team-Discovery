        <p>When you take a loan, the equated monthly instalment is a key factor in deciding the loan amount and tenure.
            The personal loan calculator helps you instantly calculate your pay-outs and, therefore, plan your loan and
            repayment better.</p>

        <p>To calculate your EMI, just enter the loan amount, rate of interest and loan tenure, and your EMI is
            instantly displayed. </p>

        <p>If you wish to change the EMI adjust any of the three sliders on the personal loan EMI calculator. If you
            wish to lower your EMI, you can do so by reducing the loan amount or the interest rate or by increasing the
            tenure. If you can afford higher monthly payments, you could consider increasing the loan amount or reducing
            your tenure.</p>



        <p>The calculator is designed to be easy-to-use and intuitive.</p>
